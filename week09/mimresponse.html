In tribal societies we are told that
it is a familiar reaction, when some hideous event
occurs, for some people to say, "How horrible it
must be to feel like that," instead of blaming somebody for having done something horrible. This feeling is an aspect of the new mass culture we are
moving intoâ€”a world of total involvement in which
everybody is so profoundly involved with everybody else and in which nobody can really imagine
what private guilt can be anymore.
