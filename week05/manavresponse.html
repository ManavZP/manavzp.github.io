            First reaction: what the heck<br><br>
            
            A highlight of this project was the idea that looking through the eyes of the dolls <br>
            using a camera is akin to being a cyborg. This is an incredibly interesting viewpoint <br>
            to look at through the lense of modern day technology, where we actually have virtual reality <br>
            machines that allow us to essentially become "cyborgs." Even on our phones, most people have <br>
            the capability to use augmented reality and can use that tech in creative ways to mimic the <br>
            project in more advanced ways.
