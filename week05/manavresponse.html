            A highlight of this project was the idea that looking through the eyes of the dolls 
            using a camera is akin to being a cyborg. This is an incredibly interesting viewpoint 
            to look at through the lense of modern day technology, where we actually have virtual reality 
            machines that allow us to essentially become "cyborgs." Even on our phones, most people have 
            the capability to use augmented reality and can use that tech in creative ways to mimic the 
            project in more advanced ways. For example, making a robot with vr-capable cameras in it's eyes
            and then connecting that to a vr headset, allowing you to control and see through the robot, 
            fully immersed.
