            The Dollie Clone series is a project created by Lynn Hershman.
            2 dolls, named CybeRoberta and Tillie the Telerobotic Doll (evil twin)
            had cameras inseted into their eyes, and they were put on display.
            <br><br>
            People could go to the website and see "live video feed" of what the dolls
            were seeing.
            <br><br>
            To quote net.art, the explored themes centered around
            "Surveillance, the fluidity of identity, clones and cyborgs, 
            and the performance of gender and the the self"
