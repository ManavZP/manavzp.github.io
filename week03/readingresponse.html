      In As We May Think, Vannevar Bush writes about technology as it stood (in 1945, time of writing), and what the future of technology
      could possibly look like. In reading the whole article, the one major point that stood out to me was the fact that he was actually 
      right! This was written in 1945. Just a few years earlier, one of the first computers was invented, and it was nothing like what we have
      today. Then, the "computer" was simply a machine that could store data in binary. That's it. Bush somehow predicted that computational
      equipment would, in the future, be as readily available to people as a simple click of a button to photograph something from your own
      glasses. What he predicted back then, now, would be the equivalent of someone saying that in the future, sentient artificial intelligence would
      be a massive part of human life. But think about it...people DO say that. To some, it may seem like a pipe dream, but based on Bush's predictions
      and the eventual truth of them, completely sentient AI may not be too far off.

      A central point about the argument of whether ISP's should have the power to interfere with a user's internet speed and managing 
      their own bandwith. However, as a user of an ISP that frequently abuses that power, I think that should not be allowed in any sense.
      However, there then still lies the issue that bandwith is not unlimited. Well here's what I say to that: FOCUS ON INCREASING THE 
      TECHNOLOGY OF BANDWITH. Decades ago, a giant room-sized computer was capable of housing a few megabytes of data. Now a small laptop
      that can fit into your backpack can store TERABYTES of data. Every single aspect of any type of technology is improvable, and I think
      if ISP's truly cared about their bandwith (you know, as opposed to selling all their juicy bandwith to high paying companies), they should
      have engineers working to advance that tech.<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">It's possible but Spectrum just hates us I guess. </p>
