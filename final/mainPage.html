        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! The name's Manav! 
        </p>
        <p>I am an engineering and design student studying at NYU. My focus is on Artificial Intelligence and Game Development.</p>
        <p>I'm very passionate about storytelling and game design, and plan to find a career in this area!</p>
        <p>I am the proud recipient of the Golden Duck Award for a game theory algorithm I wrote, and I love Cherry Pepsi.</p>
        <p>My <a id="hidden" onclick="showHome();">home</a> town is South Pasadena, CA.</p>

     <h1>DESIGN</h1>
     <p>I have lots of experience in digital design, and am still looking to expand my abilities. 
         I have been making my own websites since my freshman year of high school, and
         have multiple medals from winning regional web design competitions. 
         <br><br>
         I have been designing UI for the same amount of time as I've been making websites, but only recently started taking official classes to learn 
         graphic design and related skills.
         As far as other design projects, I started 3d modeling last year and am continuously growing my portfolio with each new design-focused class I take 
         for my degree.
       <br><br>
          Finally, you can see the evolution of my video production skills on my YouTube channel, linked in the top left. I have also made some videos for clients who have uploaded 
          them to their own channel, which I no longer have access to.

        <h1>GAMING</h1>
        <p>
            Games! I love gaming and all things gaming related. I have been playing games since I was young, my first real game being 
            Pokemon Leaf Green on the Nintendo Gameboy. Since then, my passion for games has only grown, extending into virtually every
            genre there is. Horror, fantasy rpgs, rhythm games, strategy games, first person shooters, CCGs, the list goes on and on. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Of course, I definitely have my favorites. Among those are Minecraft by Mojang, Subnautica by Unknown Worlds, Apex Legends by Respawn Entertainment, and 
            League of Legends by Riot Games. But the creme of the crop for me, and the game that actually jumpstarted my interest in going into this industry was 
            The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, by Bethesda. Without going on too long about why I love it so much, I will just say that the way it combined 
            gameplay, game design, and storytelling to create one glorious free roam RPG was something I heavily admired. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Of course, Skyrim wasn't the first game to do this, and it certainly isn't the game to have done this best. However, it was the first game 
            that I played that did that...and following that game, I became more and more intrigued with the idea of being able to invent a whole world,
            a whole universe, and then tell the story of that universe through something as immersive and interactive as a video game. And thus, I began to <a id="hidden" onclick="askCode();">code.</a>

        <h2>MY GAMES</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>The Dog-Dog Trilogy</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            My gamemaking saga begins in high school, where I developed a game in Scratch called Dog-Dog's Adventures. It follows the 
            story of Dog-Dog, the blue dog.
        </p>
        <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/136594539/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Shortly after that game, I created a sequel called Dog-Dog and the Revenge of the Mukakus. This text-based game coded in Python
            greatly expanded the lore of Dog-Dog's Universe, and created deep and meaningful character arcs...sadly it was lost to the void 
            when the school wiped our computers without telling us. Should I ever find a copy of it, it will be uploaded here.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Finally, the low-budget trequel (third sequel) to Dog-Dog's Adventures, Dog-Dog Visits Lucifer. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            In between all this Dog-Dog nonsense, I created a task-focused space game where you, an astronaut, must constantly be repairing your ship.
            I suggest playing until the end!
