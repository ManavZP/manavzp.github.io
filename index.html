            Hi! The name's Manav! 
        </p>
        <p>I am an engineering and design student studying at NYU. My focus is on Artificial Intelligence and Game Development.</p>
        <p>I'm very passionate about storytelling and game design, and plan to find a career in this area!</p>
        <p>I am the proud recipient of the Golden Duck Award for a game theory algorithm I wrote in High School.</p>
        <p>My <a id="hidden" onclick="showHome();">home</a> town is South Pasadena, CA.</p>
        <p>And I love Cherry Pepsi.</p>

     <h1>DESIGN</h1>
     <p>I have lots of experience in digital design, and I'm still looking to expand my abilities. 
         I have been making my own websites since my freshman year of high school, and
         have multiple medals from winning regional web design competitions. 
        <br><br>
        When it comes to graphic design and UI/UX, I'm still constantly developing my skills.
        <br><br>
        I'm adept at 3D Modeling, and am particularly interested in learning how to sculpt and
        model realistic humans and creatures. 
       <br><br>
          Finally, you can see the evolution of my video production skills on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQ7OUHXtPupWLl-vfEeUsQ" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. I have also made some videos for clients who have uploaded 
          them to their own channels, videos which I no longer have access to. 
          <br><br>

        <h1 id="whyGaming">WHY GAMING?</h1>
        <p>
            Games! I love gaming and all things gaming related. I have been playing games since I was young, my first real game being 
            Pokemon Leaf Green on the Nintendo Gameboy. Since then, my passion for games has only grown, extending into virtually every
            genre there is; Horror, fantasy RPGs, rhythm games, strategy games, first person shooters, CCGs, the list goes on and on. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Of course, I definitely have my favorites. Among those are Minecraft by Mojang, Subnautica by Unknown Worlds, Apex Legends by Respawn Entertainment, and 
            Legends of Runeterra by Riot Games. But the cream of the crop for me, and the game that actually jumpstarted my interest in going into this industry was 
            The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, by Bethesda. Without going on too long about why I love it so much, I will just say that the way it combined 
            gameplay, game design, and storytelling to create one glorious free roam RPG was something I truly admired. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Of course, Skyrim wasn't the first game to do these things, and it certainly isn't the game to have done these things best. However, it <i>was</i> the first game 
            that <i>I played</i> that did these things...and following that game, I became more and more intrigued with the idea of being able to create a whole world,
            a whole universe, and then tell the story of that universe through something as immersive and interactive as a video game. And thus, I began to <a id="hidden" onclick="askCode();">code.</a>

            <h3>The Dog-Dog Trilogy</h3>
            <p>
                My gamemaking saga began in high school, where I developed a game in Scratch called Dog-Dog's Adventures. It follows the 
                story of Dog-Dog, the blue dog.
                Shortly after that game, I created a sequel called Dog-Dog and the Revenge of the Mukakus. This text-based game coded in Python
                greatly expanded the lore of Dog-Dog's Universe, and created deep and meaningful character arcs...unfortunately, a package that
                was used in the code has since grown outdated, and the code no longer works.
                Finally, a year later, I developed the low-budget trequel (third sequel) to Dog-Dog's Adventures, Dog-Dog Visits Lucifer.
                Cat-Cat's Adventure, a spinoff to the Dog-Dog series, is an enemy-swarm platformer with a high learning curve. It was coded in JavaScript

                <p>
                    For one of my Game Development classes, we had to create a new game every week based on a certain prompt or inspiration. We were given 
                    one week for each game, and were allowed to use whatever game engine we wanted. Click the covers to either be directed

            <p>The digital is not the only medium I use to create interactive experiences...I also love making tabletop games!</p>
            <p>
                I started designing board games during a science project all the way back in 6th grade, and since then I have
                gone far beyond just "roll the dice to move x spaces." Though I am getting more serious about this particular part
                of my portfolio, these games are mostly all in the prototyping phase. However, I am currently planning an official
                Kickstarter campaign and talking to potential publishers to release my latest endevour, Mythos (see below!)

            <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 1em;">Mythos is my most recent project, and I'm looking to go big with it. Up until now, all my tabletop games have been made as a hobby. With this game, I am planning a Kickstarter campaign so that I can break way into the 
                tabletop industry. I made Mythos completely from scratch on my own, with some help from my family and friends for play testing and consulting.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Mythos is a competitive, party-building card game where the player creates an army of deities and mythical
                entities from religions and cultures from all around the world, and battle to see who can power up to victory.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Some of the origins include Indian, Mayan, and Egyptian Mythology, Western Astrology, Tarot, the Chinese Zodiac,
                and more. The game focuses on gradually developing board states, and is designed to highly encourage setting up
                deadly combos and planning your tactics. A special thing to note is that there is only ONE type of card in the deck: the
                entities. Each of the 112 cards is a unique unit that you may summon into your party, and each one of those comes with their
                own special abilities that are heavily inspired by their roles in the culture they are from. </p><p style="text-align: left;">With countless powerful deities,
                trap cards, alternate win conditions, and table-turning abilities, no two games of Mythos will be the same...

            <h2>Demigod Entertainment</h2>
            <img style="margin-bottom:10px;" width="200px" height="200px" src="dgelogo.svg">
            <p>Demigod Entertainment is the company I plan to start, in order to
                be able to publish and release all of my projects under my own name.
                MYTHOS, my card game, will be Demigod Entertainment's first title!

            <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
            <p>
                I am also a Dungeons and Dragons DM, and have made one full homebrew campaign. I am
                currently building two more, far larger, worlds for long-term adventures for my players.
                <br><br><a>The Curse of Ahi'a'make:</a> After shipwrecking on a seemingly deserted island, our group of adventurers are met with an unexpected welcome. 
                An old dispute between gods, a chance to uncover sinister secrets, and an island trapped in time. What could be better?
                <br><br><a>Hedera's Helix:</a> Set in the modern fantasy world of Astrigeia, players can experience ancient deities, politics, magic, technology, and more. <i>(Coming Soon)</i>
                <br><br><a>Starcrossed Gunners:</a> In space, no one can hear you team...up with your friends to explore an endless myriad
                of planets. <i>(Coming Soon)</i>
            </p>

            <h2>Thought Experiments</h2>
            <p>
                One thing I'm constantly fascinated with are thought experiments. I've always loved thinking about
                hypotheticals and theoreticals, especially when they dive deep into the human condition. 
                <br>My favorite two are The <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/browse.cgi" target="_blank">Library of Babel</a> and Roko's Basilisk.
                <br>One day, I will come up with my own thought experiments >:)
            </p>

            <h2>The Sobaverse</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite creations is what I call the Sobaverse.</p>
            <p>No, it has nothing to do with the Metaverse.</p>
            <p><i>More info on the Sobaverse is coming soon...</i></p>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Jellyfish</h2>
            <p>Although I have absolutely no proof (yet), I am 100% convinced that
                jellyfish are NOT of Earthly origins. I mean, they are sentient
                plastic bags of nothing that glow in the dark, float through the water, 
                can eat fish, and yet they don't have a brain. How?! Not to mention, they
                look incredibly creepy, with their long, thin tendrils and bulbous, blob heads.
                No, they are definitely aliens, and I intend to prove it.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Puzzles</h2>
            <p>I'm a HUGE fan of puzzles, riddles, escape rooms, secret messages, all things of that nature.</p>
            <p>Say, I wonder what happens when you click on that dragon icon?</p>
