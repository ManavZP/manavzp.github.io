        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! The name's Manav! 
        </p>
        <p>I am an engineering and design student studying at NYU. My focus is on Artificial Intelligence and Game Development.</p>
        <p>I'm very passionate about storytelling and game design, and plan to find a career in this area!</p>
        <p>I am the proud recipient of the Golden Duck Award for a game theory algorithm I wrote in High School.</p>
        <p>My <a id="hidden" onclick="showHome();">home</a> town is South Pasadena, CA.</p>
        <p>And I love Cherry Pepsi.</p>

     <h1>DESIGN</h1>
     <p>I have lots of experience in digital design, and I'm still looking to expand my abilities. 
         I have been making my own websites since my freshman year of high school, and
         have multiple medals from winning regional web design competitions. 
         <br><br>
         I have been designing UI for the same amount of time as I've been making websites, and I recently started taking official classes to learn 
         graphic design and related skills.
         As far as other design projects, I started 3d modeling last year and I am continuously growing my portfolio with each new design-focused class I take 
         for my degree.
       <br><br>
          Finally, you can see the evolution of my video production skills on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQ7OUHXtPupWLl-vfEeUsQ" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. I have also made some videos for clients who have uploaded 
          them to their own channels, which I no longer have access to.

        <h1 id="whyGaming">WHY GAMING?</h1>
        <p>
            Games! I love gaming and all things gaming related. I have been playing games since I was young, my first real game being 
            Pokemon Leaf Green on the Nintendo Gameboy. Since then, my passion for games has only grown, extending into virtually every
            genre there is; Horror, fantasy RPGs, rhythm games, strategy games, first person shooters, CCGs, the list goes on and on. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Of course, I definitely have my favorites. Among those are Minecraft by Mojang, Subnautica by Unknown Worlds, Apex Legends by Respawn Entertainment, and 
            League of Legends by Riot Games. But the cream of the crop for me, and the game that actually jumpstarted my interest in going into this industry was 
            The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, by Bethesda. Without going on too long about why I love it so much, I will just say that the way it combined 
            gameplay, game design, and storytelling to create one glorious free roam RPG was something I truly admired. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Of course, Skyrim wasn't the first game to do these things, and it certainly isn't the game to have done these things best. However, it <i>was</i> the first game 
            that <i>I played</i> that did these things...and following that game, I became more and more intrigued with the idea of being able to create a whole world,
            a whole universe, and then tell the story of that universe through something as immersive and interactive as a video game. And thus, I began to <a id="hidden" onclick="askCode();">code.</a>

            <h3>The Dog-Dog Trilogy</h3>
            <p>
                My gamemaking saga begins in high school, where I developed a game in Scratch called Dog-Dog's Adventures. It follows the 
                story of Dog-Dog, the blue dog.
                Shortly after that game, I created a sequel called Dog-Dog and the Revenge of the Mukakus. This text-based game coded in Python
                greatly expanded the lore of Dog-Dog's Universe, and created deep and meaningful character arcs...unfortunately, a package that
                was used in the code has since grown outdated, and the code no longer works.
                Finally, a year later, I developed the low-budget trequel (third sequel) to Dog-Dog's Adventures, Dog-Dog Visits Lucifer.
                Cat-Cat's Adventure, a spinoff to the Dog-Dog series, is an enemy-swarm platformer with a high learning curve. It was coded in JavaScript

                <p>
                    For one of my Game Development classes, we had to create a new game every week based on a certain prompt or inspiration. We were given 
                    one week for each game, and were allowed to use whatever game engine we wanted. Click the covers to either be directed

            <h2 id="boardGames">TABLETOP GAMES</h2>
            <p>The digital is not the only medium I use to create interactive experiences...I also love making tabletop games!</p>
            <p>
                I started designing board games during a science project all the way back in 6th grade, and since then I have
                gone far beyond just "roll the dice to move x spaces." Though I am getting more serious about this particular part
                of my portfolio, these games are mostly all in the prototyping phase. However, I am currently planning an official
                Kickstarter campaign and talking to potential publishers to release my latest endevour, Mythos (see below!) 
            </p>
            <h3>Mythos</h3>
            <img width="200" height="300" src="MythosAnubis.png"><img width="200" height="300" src="MythosAmmit.png"><img width="200" height="300" src="MythosEmperor.png"><img width="200" height="300" src="MythosWrath.png">
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 1em;">Mythos is my most recent project, and I'm looking to go big with it. Up until now, all my tabletop games have been made as a hobby. With this game, I am planning a Kickstarter campaign so that I can break way into the 
                tabletop industry. I made Mythos completely from scratch on my own, with some help from my family and friends for play testing and consulting.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Mythos is a competitive, party-building card game where the player creates an army of deities and mythical
                entities from religions and cultures from all around the world, and battle to see who can power up to victory.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Some of the origins include Indian, Mayan, and Egyptian Mythology, Western Astrology, Tarot, the Chinese Zodiac,
                and more. The game focuses on gradually developing board states, and is designed to highly encourage setting up
                deadly combos and planning your tactics. A special thing to note is that there is only ONE type of card in the deck: the
                entities. Each of the 112 cards is a unique unit that you may summon into your party, and each one of those comes with their
                own special abilities that are heavily inspired by their roles in the culture they are from. </p><p style="text-align: left;">With countless powerful deities,
                trap cards, alternate win conditions, and table-turning abilities, no two games of Mythos will be the same...
            </p>
