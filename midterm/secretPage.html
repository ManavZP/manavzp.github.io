            Congradulations! You found the secret page. This is one of
            my <a class="goBack" href="https://editor.p5js.org/not_manav/full/_-0CvY6TN">favorite projects</a> I've ever done, it is a javascript game
            created in P5. I drew all the sprites in Piskel. The game has a really high learning curve and 
            I'm offering anyone who can beat the whole thing $10. Yes,
            a real $10. It's REALLY hard. Take a picture of the win screen
            as proof :) Sound will start when you press attack (some issue with loading assets in the iframe)
            <br> The picture must be on this website (no cheating!) Good luck!<br>

            <iframe height="600px" width="600px" src="https://editor.p5js.org/not_manav/embed/_-0CvY6TN"></iframe><br>

            P.S. Professor I know you will probably see this through the code instead of the puzzle, but 
            my offer still stands. Plus you get to brag to the whole class about how you beat my
            impossible game ;)<br>
