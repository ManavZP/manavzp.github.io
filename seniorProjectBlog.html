<h1>Week 6: Minor Gameplay Changes and Graphic Design</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; color: whitesmoke;">
    This week was mostly a lot of tedious grinding in terms of designing and exporting every single one of the game components in photoshop. This includes Action Cards,
    Sea Encounters, Treasure Cards, Bounty Cards, and so on. As well as this, I also altered the gameplay a little as I make these cards...I made the following changes:
    I eliminated the Mysterious Artifact cards because they were too rare and complicated for players to engage with properly. I gave the Barrelman role the ability to
    swing over to the enemy ship to deal damage, in order for them to have something to do during ship combat. I gave the Helmsman role the ability to take evasive maneuvers
    during ship combat to give the role more variety. I gave the Gunner role the ability to fire chainshots at enemy ships to prevent the target ship from moving. Off of this,
    I eliminated the need for players to acquire chainshots - now they can buy cannonballs but have infinite chainshots. I also scrapped my idea for including lore to discover,
    and instead made the Search the Seas ability relate to finding floating cargo, treasure maps, and other various things floating in the water. This week, I hope to finish making
    all of the assets and send them for printing, as well as modeling the 3D ship that I plan to use to visualize the ship's direction, sail position, and cannons.

<h1>Week 5: Navigation and Bounty Boards</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; color: whitesmoke;"> This week I made all of the changes based on my previous playtest.
    There were a couple of significant changes I made that impacted the gameplay a little bit but the game feel a lot. The biggest changes were the new ship navigator and the new
    Pirate Bounty system. The ship navigator is, as I mentioned, a new way of representing the four components of the ship: the cannons, the anchor, the sails, and the ship's heading.
    Before, this was in the form of a large ship with different slots on it for the cannons, anchor, and sails. Beside this was the compass, which would show what direction the wind
    is blowing in. During playtesting, it was found that this system was very confusing, since the wind direction does not change but the ship's orientation on the map does change, but the larger
    ship representation is static, and thus players
    didn't know how to position the sails to catch wind. To combat this, I combined the compass with the ship, and made a smaller version of the ship in the center of the compass. Now, 
    whenever the ship turns on the map, it also turns on the compass to show what direction it is pointed. The wind is still indicated on the compass, but now the players know if the wind 
    is blowing from the back, front, or sides of the ship, and thus know how to turn the sails. 
    <br><br>
    The second change was to combat a problem the players had at the beginning of the gameplay. This game is a sandbox game, which means that players have a win condition of reaching X amount
    of points, and many different ways of earning points...so theoretically, they can do whatever they wish. But, in practice, they didn't really know where to start, and so just started
    sailing in a random direction until they came across some lost cargo, which then gave them a concrete goal to sell at the black market. To fix this, I introduced the Pirate Bounty Board, 
    wherein at each of the four Black Market Outposts, the players can pick up a pirate bounty which gives them a goal to complete for rewards. Since the players start at an outpost,
    they can easily know exactly what to do to start their game. Say the bounty they draw is to find a treasure at a specific island, now they can immediately start sailing for that island.
    They may run into challenges along the way, and they can change what they want to do, but at all times they'll have this bounty available to them. Say they reach the island but run out of 
    resources and thus cannot search for treasure anymore, now they must either sail to the rival outpost to sell the bounty and pick up a new one, or they must fish, find fish, or buy fish so they
    can continue to search for the treasure. 
    <br><br>
    Other than that, I finalized the play area setup. I have plans to playtest the new version later this week. If the playtest goes well, I will be starting on art and getting real
    game components ordered so they arrive in a few weeks.

<h1>Week 4: Playtest of First Iteration</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; color: whitesmoke;"> So, this week I finalized the first iteration of the rules and I finally had my first
    playtest. Honestly, I wish I could've gotten this done sooner, if only I had decided on the project sooner. But alas, I must work with what time I have left.
    So, before the playtest I had done some self-testing, as best I could for a solo player testing a 4 player co-op game. I didn't find some of the mechanics all
    that fun, which was worrisome for me because they were some of the core co-op mechanics. But I decided to stick to it and see what the actual playtesters thought.
    Much to my surprise, and delight, a lot of those mechanics I was worried about, such as the role-specific actions and the sailing, were well liked! There were of course
    a few tweaks I had to make, and I jotted down a ton of notes, but for the first time I actually feel like I can make this a really fun and playable game! Yes, I had
    my doubts before, but I think I was just burnt out since I'm currently working on 3 different games at the same time. But seeing players enjoy the game really makes
    it all worth it. Plus, I got a bunch of new ideas, suggestions and playtest notes for the new iteration, which I'm hoping to completely finish reworking by tomorrow night.
    Then I can get in a couple more playtests before class next week. ARGGGG!!

<h1>Week 3: Decision</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; color: whitesmoke;"> Woohoo! I finally decided, I'm going to be making the co-op pirate game.
    I still don't have a name for it, so the codename will be SeaMonkey. This one is on brand. One of my last projects was a space-horror-survival game
    and the codename was "Eclair," a year later I couldn't find any of the assets because I forgot what I named it and whenever I saw "Eclair" I had no idea
    that was my game I was staring at. Anyways, I've already begun working on a basic game outline, like the win condition, the roles each player can play,
    the core game mechanics (digging for treasure, sailing, etc.). I still have a lot to work on, but soon it will be ready to playtest, at least a rough
    prototype version. I want to ensure that I don't go too deep before testing these mechanics to make sure they are actually fun to play.

<h1>Week 2: Narrowing it Down</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; color: whitesmoke;">Alright, so I've basically narrowed it down to either a co-op pirate game where players will work together on a pirate ship to sail around,
    dig up treasure, battle sea monsters, and more, to become the most feared pirate crew on the seas...or, a competitive pirate game where players
    each take on the roles of pirate captains and sail around uncharted seas to discover islands, dig up treasure, battle sea monsters, and uncover
    the secrets of what happened to these cursed seas all those years ago...the second one I actually am already working on as a personal project,
    it's called "Curse of Elwood." But I was really interested in making a co-op game, so that's why this is a tough decision. I'm getting there.
</p>

<br>
<h1>Week 1: Concepts</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; color: whitesmoke;">This week I really didn't do all that much besides contemplate what exactly my project will be. Unlike a lot of people who don't
    have any idea what they want to do, I have way too many ideas, from a space-farming board game to a co-op pirate board game to a 
    pirate themed video game where you visit procedurally generated islands and dig up treasure to decorate your pirate hideout...
    I'm hoping that I'll be able to narrow it down in the coming week.
